# 'WEBSTER'
### a website chatbot by [hex benjamin](https://hexbenjam.in)

> adapted from a [tutorial by Jason Webster](https://jasonwebster.dev/blog/chatting-to-a-website-with-langchain-openai-and-chromadb)

## a note from the dev:
> "i thought to call this package `webster` thanks to a local town having the name & the nature of the package being built. as i write the README here, i realize that the tutorial i'm following was written by a man with the last name Webster. This is purely coincidental, albeit very funny. I mean no offense to Jason, and will happily rename the package if he so desires. Please [email hex@hexbenjam.in](mailto:hex@hexbenjam.in) in that case. ðŸ«¡"

## about
this project aims to create a chatbot that can be used to chat with a website, much as is described in the tutorial above. however, `webster` hopes to integrate the powers of [xtekky's g4f project](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free), removing the need for an API key and allowing for more flexibility & power in the chatbot's responses.
